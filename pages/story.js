              I’m a self-proclaimed, but more importantly, self-taught web
              developer. The journey towards building my professional identity
              started in the summer of 2019 as a recent college grad. Once I was
              faced with the world outside of the academic bubble, I knew I had
              some serious reflection. Although I was an academically strong
              student, I never felt at ease or challenged in my classes. To my
              surprise, I began to thrive once the rigid academic structure
              subsided. I finally understood the concept that educational
              systems preach and often fall short on implementing the
              learning-by-doing theory. My most recent project is called
              XplorePlaces, but before I get ahead of myself, let's rewind.

              My professional identity starts at my current job, where I
              developed a brainstormed idea into mapping software and eventually
              a full-stack website, called Vizlyte. One of my daily tasks
              consists of compiling consumer information that is given to our
              sales team. These comprehensive presentations aim to educate the
              media services team or the client on who the consumer is. I
              thought the mapping software would provide an easier to understand
              and more complete picture of the data that was sent to clients.
              Through many hours of brainstorming, I devised a plan to create my
              own software that would build a heat map to show where the
              consumers we pulled were heavily concentrated. The heat map would
              be composed of the data that we already provide to clients but
              would provide a visually appealing and easy-to-read display. As
              with most things in life, high aspirations come with significant
              challenges. One of which being that I had minimal experience
              piecing together HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & PHP. As I spent most of
              my spare time researching these languages and developing my idea,
              I discovered D3.js, which is a JS library for mapping geojson
              data. Honestly, the struggle to construct my software seemed
              never-ending. As I pieced together information, it seemed as if I
              took two steps backward for every 1 step forward. I usually don’t
              condone blame-shifting, but for this instance only, I blame
              Promises. I realized the attempt to create such a vast and
              intricate software might have been an ambitious first move.
              Therefore, I redirected my study to learn the basics of
              JavaScript. After a few months, I felt confident in my JavaScript
              abilities to code the heat map, and before I knew it, it was
              working! Like any victory speech, I would like to thank async,
              await, and my friends & family.

              Although coworkers gave me a strange look when I explained that I
              enjoyed using my Thursday nights and Saturday mornings to develop
              software for work, I was excited that I established a new passion.
              I subsequently turned the software into a full-stack application
              to be used by my team members. To do this, I used vanilla JS,
              Node, Express, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB and called it Vizlyte. The
              heatmap is used in ~80% of our consumer reports, and on average,
              75% of my team members use the application daily.

              Due to my Vizlyte dedication, I mistakenly deprived myself of the
              most crucial part of my identity, soccer. Once I moved to Chicago,
              I realized that I no longer had access to the suburban soccer
              fields that I, along with local little league soccer players,
              treasured. To my dismay, finding a publicly accessible soccer
              field was harder than finding a regular ice cream parlor in the
              city. Using my newly developed tech skills, I created a simple web
              application that allows users to add markers to indicate
              accessible sports fields. This application uses GoogleMaps and a
              variety of symbols to designate the field type. You can check out
              DiscoverFields here and add your favorite spot!

              As stated before, I learn best by doing, so that is exactly what I
              continue to do. At this point in my professional development, I
              knew that I had found a passion for developing software. More
              importantly, I had invoked a curiosity for learning that is not
              controlled by a GPA. As I began brainstorming my next project, I
              read about React, and wanted to check it out. To practice my
              skills, I created a React E-commerce website that includes all of
              the essential functions. While it is no fullstack Nike ecommerce
              store, I am incredibly proud of how fast I acquired this skillset.

              Returning to suburbia as the COVID-19 lockdown ramped up, I began
              thinking about what a person would prioritize as they settled into
              a permanent home. Additionally, as scientific information filled
              my television, I realized that public data is everywhere, but
              without a streamlined system for an average consumer to utilize
              it, it is fundamentally useless. These thoughts prompted my latest
              project, called XplorePlaces. This web application ranks U.S.
              metro areas and counties in order for a person to find their ideal
              community in a way that is user friendly. XplorePlaces uses public
              data to rank communities in 6-7 (and growing) data points. The
              application is built using React, CSS, Node, Express, Chartjs, and
              Postgresql. As a personal challenge, each project I begin, I add
              two new software types to advance my knowledge in the endlessly
              evolving tech world.

              Currently, I am searching for opportunities to develop my passion
              into my career by looking for an entry level position with a
              company that supports the growth of their employees. I have
              endless potential to offer as a hardworking, curious life-long
              learner.

              On a more personal note, I do enjoy numerous things outside of
              tech development as well! As stated, watching and playing soccer
              has always been my favorite form of exercise and socializing. I
              consider myself an ice cream connoisseur and love trying new
              foods. After 23 years, I finally made it out of the country and
              found an endless love of travel. I spent this past Christmas in
              Central Europe and Spain, attempting to find the best dessert
              Europe has to offer.
